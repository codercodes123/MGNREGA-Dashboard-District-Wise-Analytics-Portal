    "aboutDesc": "The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is a social security measure that aims to guarantee the 'right to work' and ensure livelihood security in rural areas. It provides at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.",
    "q1": "How often is the data updated?",
    "a1": "The data is updated monthly from the official MGNREGA portal (nrega.nic.in). Our dashboard refreshes automatically every 6 hours to ensure you see the latest information.",
    "q2": "What does 'Person Days' mean?",
    "a2": "Person Days represents the total number of days of employment generated. For example, if 10 people work for 5 days each, that equals 50 person days. It's a key metric to measure employment generation under MGNREGA.",
    "q3": "Can I compare different districts?",
    "a3": "Yes! Visit the Leaderboard section to see all 35 Maharashtra districts ranked by performance. You can compare employment generation, expenditure, and overall scores across districts.",
    "q4": "How can I report incorrect data?",
    "a4": "If you notice any discrepancies, please contact us at support@mgnrega.gov.in or call the toll-free helpline. Please provide specific details about the district and the data you're questioning.",
    "q5": "Is this data official?",
    "a5": "Yes, all data is sourced directly from data.gov.in and the official MGNREGA portal. This dashboard presents the data in a more accessible format for citizens.",
    "q6": "How are districts ranked?",
    "a6": "Districts are ranked using a performance score calculated from: Total Person-Days (60% weight) + Total Expenditure (40% weight). Scores are normalized to ensure fair comparison across all districts."
